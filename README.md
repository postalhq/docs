# Postal Server Documentation
Postal is a complete and fully-featured mail server for use by websites and web servers. Think of Sendgrid, Mailgun, or Postmark, but open source and ready for you to run on your own servers. Postal was developed by aTech Media to serve its own mail processing requirements, and we have since decided that it should be released as an open-source project for the community. It was originally launched by us as AppMail but was renamed to Postal as part of making it open source because we felt the name was more suitable.

## The Purpose of This Repository
This repository hosts the documentation for Postal only. If you are looking for the GitHub repository for the application source code, [go to the open-source repository for Postal â†’](https://github.com/postalserver/postal)

## Contribution Instructions

## How to Edit the Docs Content?
This documentation uses [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) and works on the following key concepts:
- Content is stored as markdown files in the `/content` folder.
- Pages are sorted by the number at the beginning of their MD file. 
- Pages need to have a title and description as their metadata.
- You can use any Nuxt UI and [Nuxt UI Pro prose component](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/prose/callout).
