## Setting up SpamAssassin

By default, Postal will talk to SpamAssassin's `spamd` using an TCP socket connection (port 783). You'll need to install SpamAssassin on your server and then enable it within Postal.

### Installing SpamAssassin

```
sudo apt install spamassassin
```

#### Systemd systems
On systems that use systemd (e.g. Debian Bookworm), you will need to enable the SpamAssassin timer. It is used to udpate the spam rules (which can be done manually using `sa-update`).

```shell
systemctl enable --now spamassassin-maintenance.timer
```

#### Other systems
On other systems, you will need to open up `/etc/default/spamassassin` and change `ENABLED` to `1` and  `CRON` to `1`. On some systems (such as Ubuntu 20.04 or newer), you might need to enable the SpamAssassin daemon with the following command.

```bash
update-rc.d spamassassin enable 
```

Then you should restart SpamAssassin.

```
sudo systemctl restart spamassassin
```

### Enabling in Postal

To enable spam checking, you'll need to add the following to your `postal.yml` configuration file and restart. If you have installed SpamAssassin on a different host to your Postal installation you can change the host here but be sure to ensure that the `spamd` is listening on your external interfaces.

```yaml
spamd:
  enabled: true
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 783
```

```
postal stop
postal start
```

### Classifying Spam

The spam system is based on a numeric scoring system and different scores are assigned to different issues which may appear in a message. You can configure different thresholds which define when a message is treated as spam. We recommend starting at 5 and updating this once you've seen how your incoming messages are classified.

You have three options which can be configured on a per route basis which defines how spam messages are treated:

* **Mark** - messages will be sent through to your endpoint but the spam information will be made available to you.
* **Quarantine** - the message will placed into your hold queue and you'll need to release them if you wish them to be passed to your application. They will only remain here for 7 days,
* **Fail** - the message will be marked as failed and will only be recorded in your message history without being sent.
